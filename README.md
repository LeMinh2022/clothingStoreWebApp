# clothingStoreWebApp
This is a project about a second-hand clothes shop, the product development project is a phone app for customers to buy online, accompanied by a management page of the store owner on the web platform.


The BE side we build with PHP and the app side we use Java. The project is carried out by 2 members, me and my classmate Nguyen Van Thinh.
To carry out the project, we received great support from Mr. Nguyen Duy Hoang, a lecturer at FPT Aptech.
